# Deep-learning-based-HCC-diagnosis-
This project is about the analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Deep learning based HCC diagnosis, liver and liver tumor segmentation using 3D unet architecture. The 3D unet is trained with CT scan volumes to efficiently learn liver segmentation and liver tumor segmentation.
# Project steps
# Step 1: Dataset Preparation
The dataset for this project is the publically avalaible dataset LiTS(Liver tumor segmentation) https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094
# Step 2: Preprocessing 
There ar a number of preprocessing and filtering techniques and enhancement approaches for 3D CT scan volumes
i. Median Filtering
ii. Enhancement Filter 
iii. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization 
iv. Auto-enhancement 
v. Wiener filter
vi. Fast Fourier Transform 
vii. Wavelet Transform
viii. Antigeometric Diffusion 
ix. Erosion Filter 
x. Smoothing filters
xi. Noise Correction
# Median Filter
Median filter is applied kernel size=2 the results are as follows 1. Original image 2. Preprocessed image
